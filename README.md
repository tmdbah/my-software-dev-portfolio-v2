# Secure Software Developer Portfolio Project v1 Refactored

First iteration of my Secure Software Developer Portfolio Project refactored and tracked using git for version control.

In this project I planned, designed, developed, tested, evaluated, deployed, and maintained a software, web, and mobile developer portfolio website.
